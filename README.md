## Whiteboard ORC

### setup
- clone the project
- npm install
- plug an android device with usb-debugging enabled
- react-native run-android
- npm start

The application should be running on your phone.


### current state
- The mobile application is **not working** as the file is not uploaded to firebase. Only few steps are required as it used to work with minor changes (wich sadly got lost due to an enraged unicorn).
- The app was not tested for IOS and some package linking dependencies might be missing for it to work.
